# Network Security DES Implementation

## How to Run

### Using `main.py`
- Run `main.py` to encrypt and decrypt data using the DES algorithm.
- The "Decrypt" option will decrypt the most recently encrypted text you entered.

### Using Server and Client
1. Run `server.py` to start the server.
2. Run `client.py` to connect to the server.
   - The server handles decryption, while the client is used for encryption.
